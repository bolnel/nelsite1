      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, you &lt;a href=&#34;https://ninel.work/articles/are-certifications-worth-it/&#34;&gt;decided that it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea&lt;/a&gt; to get a cybersecurity certification. But which one should you go for?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While obtaining a certification is quite an endeavor, that’s only the first step. To keep it active, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to pay annual fees and submit continuous education units based on the issuers’ requirements.

Licensure and certification are both means of verifying your skills and expertise, but they have some &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.differencebetween.net/language/words-language/difference-between-certification-and-licensure/&#34;&gt;distinct differences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, a license is issued by a government authority and is legally required to practice in a field or hold a certain title. Certification is voluntary, serving as a reassurance to your peers and clients that you meet specific qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
