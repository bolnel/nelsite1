<h2 id="from-software-developer-to-an-agile-coach">From software developer to an Agile Coach</h2>
<p><strong><em>Ninel: I read that you wanted to become a detective in your childhood. How did you become a software developer, and, eventually, an Scrum Trainer?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Alexander</strong>: I studied at the Department of Mathematics and Computer Sciences but didn&rsquo;t graduate: in 1995, the internet fascinated me and I started working as a web developer.</p>
<p>I came to Agile and Scrum in the early 2000s. I wanted to improve the process as a whole – not only in the small programming niche I worked in. We started with eXtreme Programming and Agile practices.</p>
<p>In the following years, Scrum was getting more popular. In 2008, I took my first Scrum Master training by Scrum Alliance. That was my first step towards Scrum mastery, and I became a Scrum Trainer a few years later.</p>
<h2 id="advice-to-myself-from-the-past">Advice to myself from the past</h2>
<p>The most important advice to my past self would be to <strong>start working independently</strong> earlier.</p>
<p>I waited for too long to start working for myself and missed several opportunities in my life that I could’ve taken earlier. Embracing uncertainty was difficult for me.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it helped me get more professional before I launched my independent career.</p>
<h2 id="seeing-and-seizing-professional-opportunities">Seeing and seizing professional opportunities</h2>
<p>I see opportunities as waves. For example, the Internet itself was a wave. With this wave, I found a profession.</p>
<p>With the rise of Scrum and Agile, I found something I’m passionate about.</p>
<p>I didn’t do any special research to find those waves. I just saw them and realized that, yes, that’s a big thing, and I want to be a part of that. Keep your eyes open for opportunities.</p>
<p>What will the next wave be? We’ll see what happens. But when the next wave is coming, I want to be prepared to ride this wave better and in a more efficient way. AI is on the rise now, it&rsquo;s probably the next game changer.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-your-definition-of-success">What is your definition of “success”?</h2>
<p>I think “success” is an endless journey. Whenever I reach my goal, I’m already thinking about the next goal. It’s a continuous process of moving forward.</p>
<p>And then, looking backward, there are some things I could say I’m proud of.</p>
<p>But sometimes it also happens in the moment. For example, you were coding something for a while, and then it works – you immediately feel that it’s a success.</p>
<p>For me, success is not about being popular. It’s about having things that I did well and could be proud of. It also feels great when another person reaches their goal with my help.</p>
<h2 id="did-luck-play-a-role-in-where-you-are-today">Did luck play a role in where you are today?</h2>
<p>When we think of luck, what comes to mind is something sudden, something we didn’t do anything for – but something great just happens… This kind of luck is rare.</p>
<p>I think it’s more about the opportunities. When you see an opportunity, it all depends on how you act. But first of all, you need to learn to see opportunities.</p>
<p>Let me give an example.</p>
<p>I played a game for a few years. A simple game: you need to find money on the street. As you go about your day, you look for coins.</p>
<p>In my first year, I found around 30 cents, the next year it was more than 1 Euro in total. There were over 3 Euros in a year after that, and I even found a banknote of 30 Euros. I found it just because I thought of it.</p>
<p>You could say that finding this money by random chance was luck. But I saw it because I focused on the opportunity.</p>

<h2 id="are-there-any-books-you-would-recommend-reading">Are there any books you would recommend reading?</h2>
<p>I recommend books by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Hesse">Hermann Hesse</a>, a German poet and novelist. I read a few of his novels many years ago, but they left a lasting impression. I’d call them “mind-changing”.</p>
<p>In those books, the characters are often strangers, outsiders – but from their perspective, they’re doing the right thing.</p>
<p>If you’re asking about my main takeaway from those books, it’s “live your life, have your own identity”.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-your-aspirations-for-the-near-future">What are your aspirations for the near future?</h2>
<p>I want to grow my training business to the point where I don’t need to take part in everyday operations and be more of a shareholder.</p>
<p>How could you scale training? If there’s a signature method you created, you could have coaches on your team who use the method. This way, it’s easier to find your dream clients.</p>
<p>Typically, from my experience, when you’re hired as a coach, you could help individuals to get better at what they’re doing, but you can’t change the company culture. I did facilitate change in some situations. But in general, the bigger the company, the more difficult it gets.</p>
<p>Even as an individual, it’s difficult to change your behavior. You can imagine what it’s like on the organizational level.</p>
<p>I’m going to niche down and specialize in working with smaller and medium-sized organizations.</p>
