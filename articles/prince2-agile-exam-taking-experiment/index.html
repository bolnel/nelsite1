  <section><p>You need to answer barely over half of the questions to pass the test.</p>
<p>That doesn’t sound like a challenge. Or does it?..</p>
<p>When I first learned that the pass mark for PRINCE2 certifications by Axelos is about 55%, it almost struck me as an unfair advantage. For example, the passing score for the <a href="https://ninel.work/articles/psm-1-certification-exam-preparation/">Professional Scrum Master exam</a> is 85%. That exam, however, doesn’t have any kind of proctoring.</p>
<p>PRINCE2 is proctored, but on the Practitioner level, you’re allowed to use the official manual. At 55%, is it even possible to fail?</p>
<p>I got curious if I could pass those exams using only my current knowledge, general logic, and minimum reading on the subject.</p>
<p class="paragraph_highlight">No courses, no textbook, no looking things up as you do the test. Will I still score enough points?</p>
<p>Let’s find out.</p>
<p>In this article, I’ll tell you about my results going through the sample exam papers or PRINCE2 and PRINCE2 Agile Foundation and Practitioner provided by Axelos.</p>
<p>Perhaps my observations and results would help you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get a better idea of which PRINCE2 certification you want to attempt</li>
<li>Note some possible pitfalls and plan your studying</li>
<li>Be confident about passing the PRINCE2 and PRINCE2 Agile professional certification exams</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="prince2-no-textbook-exam-experiment-the-setup">PRINCE2 no-textbook exam experiment: the setup</h2>
<p>Paying for the Foundation and Practitioner levels of both PRINCE2 and PRINCE2 Agile exams would’ve cost me a couple thousand dollars.</p>
<p>But fortunately, every PRINCE2 certification comes with a full sample version of the exam. The samples are available for download on their respective certification pages, in the Resources section at the bottom of the page:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.axelos.com/certifications/propath/prince2-project-management/prince2-foundation">PRINCE2 Foundation full exam sample</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.axelos.com/certifications/propath/prince2-project-management/prince2-practitioner">PRINCE2 Practitioner sample exam paper</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.axelos.com/certifications/propath/prince2-agile-project-management/prince2-agile-foundation">PRINCE2 Agile Foundation: a full set of exam questions</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.axelos.com/certifications/propath/prince2-agile-project-management/prince2-agile-practitioner">PRINCE2 Agile Practitioner sample exam</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Those materials are another reason for my impression that PRINCE2 exams are impossible to fail.</p>
<p>The syllabus and the answer rationales provided are detailed and give a very clear idea of what the test will be asking and what the logic of the answers is.</p>

<h2 id="subject-characteristics-and-test-conditions">Subject characteristics and test conditions</h2>
<p>Here are a few points going into the experiment – what I already had, what I did and didn&rsquo;t do:</p>
<ul>
<li>I had a deep dive into Scrum and Agile during my <a href="https://ninel.work/articles/psm-2-certification-exam-preparation/">preparation for the Professional Scrum Master level II exam</a>.</li>
<li>While <a href="https://ninel.work/articles/pmp-certification-exam-preparation/">preparing for the PMP exam</a>, I obtained a solid understanding of Waterfall project management according to PMBOK.</li>
<li>I enjoy learning and have experience quickly digesting and using various kinds of new information.</li>
</ul>
<p>I took PRINCE2 Foundation and Practitioner back-to-back and took PRINCE2 Agile Foundation and Practitioner the next day.</p>

<h2 id="materials-used-to-prepare-for-the-prince2-experiment">Materials used to prepare for the PRINCE2 experiment</h2>
<p>My biggest concern is whether the information about the PRINCE2 method will be openly available. Is it a sacred or obscure knowledge you could only possess if you lay your hands on the book? Or are the various elements of the method described and discussed in various sources?</p>
<p>Besides the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRINCE2">PRINCE2 Wikipedia page</a>, my main source of information was the <a href="https://prince2.wiki/">PRINCE2 wiki</a>. It lays out quite a detailed and comprehensive explanation of the PRINCE2 method elements. I binged all pages within a few hours.</p>
<p>Another source was the <a href="https://prince2agile.wiki/">PRINCE2 Agile wiki</a>. The materials there are much briefer. I read through some articles there and looked up more information on specific concepts elsewhere.</p>
<p>But overall, I didn’t try to dive into PRINCE2 Agile as much as I did into the core PRINCE2 method. I was excited to start on the exams – just go in with what I had at that point and let the situation unfold however it would.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: PRINCE2 and PRINCE2 Agile wikis are created by an Accredited Training Provider, Management Plaza, so it&rsquo;s no coincidence that all links to courses and exams lead there. P3.express, a project management framework created by the authors of the wiki, is also promoted there.</p>
<p><strong>Related</strong>: <a href="https://ninel.work/articles/pmp-prince2-certifications-differences/">PRINCE2 vs. PMP certification comparison</a>.</p>
<h2 id="assumptions-of-the-prince2-exam-experiment">Assumptions of the PRINCE2 exam experiment</h2>
<p>I have four basic assumptions, one for each of the four tests I was about to take. Or, rather, the same assumption for PRINCE2 Foundation, PRINCE2 Practitioner, PRINCE2 Agile Foundation, and PRINCE2 Practitioner:</p>
<p class="paragraph_highlight">“Given the low passing score, it’s possible to obtain the pass mark with previous Waterfall and Agile knowledge and a few hours of preparation using free sources”.</p>
<p>But here are a couple of extra assumptions.</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ll score better on PRINCE2 Agile tests than on classic PRINCE2 because I’ve been familiar with Agile concepts for a while.</li>
<li>I’ll score better on Practitioner exams than on their Foundation counterparts. Specific facts may slip my mind, but I could use logic to determine the correct answer to the scenario-based questions on the Practitioner level.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s see which of my assumptions will prove true.</p>

<h2 id="prince2-foundation-passing-the-test-after-reading-the-wiki">PRINCE2 Foundation: passing the test after reading the wiki</h2>
<p><strong>PRINCE2 Foundation passing score</strong>: 33/60 correct answers (55%).</p>
<p><strong>Ninel’s score</strong>: 41/60 (68%).</p>
<p>Not the highest score, but a relatively confident <strong><span style="color:#53da0a;">pass</span></strong>.</p>
<h2 id="prince2-practitioner-attempting-the-exam-with-almost-no-preparation">PRINCE2 Practitioner: attempting the exam with almost no preparation</h2>
<p><strong>PRINCE2 Practitioner passing score</strong>: 38/68 correct answers (55%).</p>
<p><strong>Ninel’s score</strong>: 39/68 (57%).</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#53da0a;">Passed</span></strong>, just barely.</p>
<p>When checking the answers, I felt like an action movie hero running across a crumbling stone bridge, jumping off at the last second. The result wasn’t certain until the very end, but I eventually made it.</p>
<h2 id="prince2-agile-foundation-passing-the-sample-exam-successfully">PRINCE2 Agile Foundation: passing the sample exam successfully</h2>
<p><strong>PRINCE2 Agile Foundation passing score</strong>: 28/50 correct answers (55%).</p>
<p><strong>Ninel’s score</strong>: 37/50 (74%).</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#53da0a;">Passed</span></strong>, with the best score overall.</p>
<p>The test asked a lot about the core concepts of PRINCE2, which I understood well at that point. I didn’t quite know what were the definitions of some of the PRINCE2 Agile-specific concepts mentioned, but still got most of such questions right using general Agile approaches.</p>
<h2 id="prince2-agile-practitioner-could-you-pass-it-with-logic-alone">PRINCE2 Agile Practitioner: could you pass it with logic alone?</h2>
<p><strong>PRINCE2 Agile Practitioner passing score</strong>: 30/50 correct answers (60%).</p>
<p><strong>Ninel’s score</strong>: 27/50 (54%).</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:red;">Failed</span></strong>.</p>
<p>Like with PRINCE2 Practitioner, it often felt like a gamble.</p>
<p>When I was checking the answers, there were a few glimpses of hope when a stretch of correct answers occurred, but after a final dry stretch, I fell a few points short.</p>
<p>There were multiple occasions where I couldn’t confidently decide between the possible options, or even when no option felt “right”. This, of course, indicates that I didn’t have a solid understanding of the material.</p>
<h2 id="did-my-prince2-exam-assumptions-come-true">Did my PRINCE2 exam assumptions come true?</h2>
<p>So, my “passing the exam” assumption turned out correct three times out of four. Here are my exam scores, in ascending order:</p>
<ul>
<li>PRINCE2 Agile Practitioner: <strong>54%</strong>.</li>
<li>PRINCE2 Practitioner: <strong>57%</strong>.</li>
<li>PRINCE2 Foundation: <strong>68%</strong>.</li>
<li>PRINCE2 Agile Foundation: <strong>74%</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do these results confirm or disprove my extra assumptions?</p>
<h3 id="1-scoring-better-on-prince2-agile-tests-than-on-classic-prince2">1. Scoring better on PRINCE2 Agile tests than on classic PRINCE2</h3>
<p>That was <strong><span style="color:#f5cc07;">partially true</span>.</strong></p>
<p>The PRINCE2 Agile Foundation score was better than Practitioner and the highest overall.</p>
<p>However, the PRINCE2 Agile Practitioner score was the lowest and didn’t hit the pass mark.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:red">False</span></strong>.</p>
<p>Before taking the tests, I actually checked and answered a few questions from the PRINCE2 Practitioner exam paper when writing the article about <a href="https://ninel.work/articles/prince2-certification-exam-preparation/">PRINCE2 exam preparation</a>.</p>
<p>But by the time I wrote the <a href="https://ninel.work/articles/prince2-agile-certification-exam-preparation/">guide to pass the PRINCE2 Agile exam</a>, I was committed to the experiment, so I didn’t look at the sample paper beforehand.</p>
<p>The current assumption was based on an idealistic view of a scenario-based exam. However, while there was a scenario to give context, the questions themselves mostly weren’t the “what’s the best course of action in this situation” type – rather, the test asked “how is this action interpreted through the lens of a specific concept of PRINCE2 Agile”.</p>
<p class="paragraph_highlight">Which, admittedly, PRINCE2 Agile is all about. It’s an interface between the classic PRINCE2 method and the Agile ways of delivery, and that’s precisely what it’s testing.</p>
<p>But I underestimated just <em>how</em> specialized the PRINCE2 Agile Practitioner exam is, so I wasn’t tuned to that type of questions.</p>
<p>However, reading the explanations for the answers, it was fascinating to get a deeper look into the blend of a traditional project management method with Agile.</p>
<p>It felt like looking into the source code of elaborate software that is very specialized and most people who have it installed actively use only a handful of its functions. If nothing else, I admire it as a piece of art.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions-and-lessons-learned">Conclusions and lessons learned</h2>
<p>Professional certification exams aren&rsquo;t just about scoring on a test and getting a badge. What’s important is the <a href="https://ninel.work/articles/are-certifications-worth-it/">information and insights you obtained</a>.</p>
<p>Enhancing your resume with a credential is a bonus.</p>
<p>Challenging myself to take some of the most prestigious project management professional certification tests was a delightful experience. I learned new things, both about the PRINCE2 method and the PRINCE2 exams by Axelos.</p>
<p>Here are a few notes and suggestions for those who are considering the PRINCE2 or PRINCE2 Agile certifications:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you have a relevant textbook, it’s guaranteed that you pass the exam at any level.</li>
<li>To get more questions right, analyze the right and wrong answers from the exam papers and understand their angle.</li>
<li>PRINCE2 Agile Foundation has more to do <a href="https://ninel.work/articles/develop-agile-mindset-guide/">with the Agile spirit</a> than PRINCE2 Agile Professional.</li>
</ol>
<p>Keep in mind that since 2023, the Foundation-level certifications by Axelos also need to be renewed every three years.</p>

<h2 id="the-biggest-mystery-of-prince2-exams-use-a-pencil-not-pen">The biggest mystery of PRINCE2 exams: “use a pencil, NOT pen”</h2>
<p>A thing that baffled me the most is the line of instruction in all sample papers, meant for in-person exams:</p>
<p>“Mark your answers on the answer sheet provided. Use a pencil (NOT pen).”</p>

<p>My initial guesses why this may be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gives you a chance to change your mind, erase and correct the answers. The policies about using the eraser aren’t explicitly stated, however.</li>
<li>The ink seeps through the paper, leaves markings on the other side, and makes the test harder to check somehow.</li>
<li>Pencil markings can be completely erased after the test and the answer sheet repurposed for another test taker, thus saving paper and helping the environment.</li>
</ol>
<p>But at the moment, “why pencil” is the only question from the PRINCE2 exam sample paper that remains unanswered.</p>
