<p class="mimic-h3">Authors</p>
<p><strong>Don McGreal</strong> is an Agile coach specializing in larger organizations. He taught classes for over a decade as a Professional Scrum Trainer.</p>
<p><strong>Ralph Jocham</strong> is a founder of an Agile consulting company and the first Scrum.org trainer from Europe, giving training to professionals since 2010.</p>
<p class="mimic-h3">What this book is about</p>
<p>Scrum is a framework used in many companies that adopted Agile. In Scrum, the Product Owner is the person accountable for maximizing the <strong>product value</strong>. How do we make sure we give the users the best experience possible, and how does Scrum help with that?</p>
<p>Some of the topics <em>The Professional Product Owner</em> book focuses on:</p>
<ul>
<li>How Product Management and Scrum go together</li>
<li>How to measure and predict value</li>
<li>Using Evidence-Based management to reduce risks</li>
<li>Backlog management techniques</li>
<li>Scaling: managing multiple teams and products</li>
</ul>
<p>Like the game of Monopoly, everyone has heard of Scrum and many have used it, but not that many people have read the actual rules.</p>
<p>The book will be interesting to those who want to get the Scrum perspective on product development.</p>

<p class="mimic-h3">Authors</p>
<p><strong>David J. Bland</strong> helps companies test new products and find product-market fit using lean startup and business model innovation. His customers include Toyota, Adobe, and HP.</p>
<p><strong>Alexander Osterwalder</strong> is one of the world’s most influential innovation experts, known for turning complex concepts of strategy development into digestible visual models. He’s one of the inventors of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas">Business Model Canvas</a>.</p>
<p class="mimic-h3">What this book is about</p>
<p>What sets this book apart is how visually engaging it is. The infographic-style presentation makes the ideas pop out more.</p>
<p>But it’s not just about the presentation – the concepts explained are also highly practical. It’s a step-by-step guide on testing and verifying your key business assumptions to minimize risk.</p>
<p><em>Testing Business Ideas</em> shares many case studies, or “experiments”, you could draw from.</p>
<p>An earlier book in the series is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118968050">Value Proposition Design: How to Create Products and Services Customers Want</a> (2014).</p>

<p class="mimic-h3">Author</p>
<p><strong>Nir Eyal</strong> is a behavioral design consultant and a popular author and speaker. He has taught marketing at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.</p>
<p class="mimic-h3">What this book is about</p>
<p>Starting with its cover and title, <em>Hooked</em> is pretty open about its intent to manipulate the brain into getting addicted to a product.</p>
<p>The “variable reward” step is a dead giveaway – we’re talking about the <a href="https://behavioralscientist.org/21st-century-skinner-box/">classic Skinner Box</a> here, wrapped in a sleek modern design. The Skinner Box principle of “uncertain but likely pleasing” result is what makes people gamble, buy lottery tickets, and engage in other kinds of behaviors that aren’t easy to put down.</p>
<p>Purposefully using those tactics might seem unscrupulous, but exploiting human psychology for profit has been done since the dawn of time. The book does have a section discussing ethical concerns.</p>
<p>This technique lends itself best to apps, social networks, games, and other products you want the users to compulsively launch again and again.</p>
<p>It would also be a curious read for anyone who wants to be aware of their habits and consumer behaviors.</p>

<h2 id="classic-books-on-agile-product-management">Classic books on Agile product management</h2>
<p>There are a few books that used to top the charts, but the modern world moves fast.</p>
<p>What was a breakthrough innovation yesterday is common knowledge today, and newer books on Agile and Product Management build upon this knowledge and introduce fresh insights.</p>
<p>However, the core principles described in those books hold true to this day. If you haven’t read those classics yet, you might want to check them out to see how – and if – the approaches changed over time.</p>
<p>The stories they tell and the questions they ask are still relevant.</p>
