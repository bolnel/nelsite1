      <description>To maintain the standards and enhance the credibility of its certifications, PMI randomly audits a number of applicants.
Project Management Professional is the most popular certification by PMI, so the audit is usually discussed in the context of PMP. But those who apply for CAPM, PMI-ACP, and other certifications could be audited as well.
If selected for audit, they’ll have to present proof of work experience, academic education, and contact hours they listed on their application.</description>

      <description>Project Management Professional certification is the most recognized PM credential worldwide.
You most likely saw the PMP abbreviation way before you started looking into obtaining a certification, and probably even before you took on a project management role.
As the world adopts Agile approaches more and more, you might be wondering: is PMP still relevant?
The short answer is “yes”. The certification issuer, PMI, constantly adapts. With the recent exam modifications and the introduction of a flexible pricing structure, taking the PMP exam is a great option for anyone who fits the eligibility requirements.</description>

      <description>Let me make a few assumptions about you.
I assume that at this point you’re sure that project management is the right occupation for you.
Most probably, you already work as a PM and want to enhance your professional profile and gain new knowledge by getting a professional certification.
PMP is recognized worldwide, but PRINCE2 is also a well-known and respected project management certification.
In this article, we’ll talk about their similarities and differences, which one is harder to get, and which of them will be the most relevant for you.</description>

      <description>Spoiler alert: the PRINCE2 Foundation and Practitioner exams themselves are relatively easy, as far as the certification exams go. You need to get a little over half of the questions right to pass, versus around 70% for PMP or 85% for PSM.
But figuring out the exam cost and actually booking it is less than straightforward…

      <description>Product Owner isn&amp;rsquo;t a job title but an accountability in Scrum.

This requires a combination of business acumen, market awareness, leadership skills, intuition, and other factors.
Will obtaining the Professional Scrum Product Owner certification prove – and improve – those skills? Is getting PSPO worth it?</description>

Cynefin (spelled “kuh-NEV-in”) is a “sense-making” framework. It aims to help with the understanding of what kind of a situation you’re in and what is the optimal course of action in this situation.

      <description>Does your &amp;ldquo;gut feeling&amp;rdquo; ever lie to you?
How many times did you wish you trusted your initial instinct? Or regretted the decision you made without thinking it through because at the moment it felt &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo;? Are you irritated that ` you keep overthinking things, and the opportunities slip away?
Intuition is a spontaneous insight without conscious reasoning. It&amp;rsquo;s not necessarily correct. But when we talk about developing intuition, the intent is learning to make quick judgments that would bring desirable outcomes.</description>

      <description>So, you decided that it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to get a cybersecurity certification. But which one should you go for?
While obtaining a certification is quite an endeavor, that’s only the first step. To keep it active, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to pay annual fees and submit continuous education units based on the issuers’ requirements. Otherwise, your hard-earned credential will expire, and it will be forbidden and unethical to introduce yourself as a certification holder by listing it in your CV or profile headline.</description>

      <description>If the job you seek requires a license, then making a decision is easy – you don&amp;rsquo;t really have a choice. Licensure and certification are both means of verifying your skills and expertise, but they have some distinct differences.
In a nutshell, a license is issued by a government authority and is legally required to practice in a field or hold a certain title. Certification is voluntary, serving as a reassurance to your peers and clients that you meet specific qualifications.</description>
