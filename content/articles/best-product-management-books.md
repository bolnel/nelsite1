## 8. Outcomes over outputs: creating tangible value

{{<booksplash cover_name="escaping-build-trap-cover.jpg" title="Escaping the Build Trap: How Effective Product Management Creates Real Value" link="https://www.amazon.com/Escaping-Build-Trap-Effective-Management/dp/149197379X" >}}

## 9. How to make an addictive product

{{<booksplash cover_name="hooked-book-cover.jpg" title="Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products" link="https://www.amazon.com/Hooked-How-Build-Habit-Forming-Products/dp/1591847788" >}}

<p class="mimic-h3">Author</p>

**Nir Eyal** is a behavioral design consultant and a popular author and speaker. He has taught marketing at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.

<p class="mimic-h3">What this book is about</p>

Starting with its cover and title, _Hooked_ is pretty open about its intent to manipulate the brain into getting addicted to a product.

The “variable reward” step is a dead giveaway – we’re talking about the [classic Skinner Box](https://behavioralscientist.org/21st-century-skinner-box/) here, wrapped in a sleek modern design. The Skinner Box principle of “uncertain but likely pleasing” result is what makes people gamble, buy lottery tickets, and engage in other kinds of behaviors that aren’t easy to put down.

Purposefully using those tactics might seem unscrupulous, but exploiting human psychology for profit has been done since the dawn of time. The book does have a section discussing ethical concerns.

This technique lends itself best to apps, social networks, games, and other products you want the users to compulsively launch again and again.

It would also be a curious read for anyone who wants to be aware of their habits and consumer behaviors.



## 10. Product-led growth for SaaS companies

{{<booksplash cover_name="product-led-growth-cover.jpg" title="Product-Led Growth: How to Build a Product That Sells Itself" link="https://www.amazon.com/Product-Led-Growth-Build-Product-Itself-ebook/dp/B07P6288ZF" >}}

_Product-Led Growth_ is focused on finding the right business model and delivering value in the context of Software-as-a-Service companies.

It teaches how to avoid common mistakes, develop the optimization process, and increase the Average Revenue Per User (ARPU).

The stories they tell and the questions they ask are still relevant.
