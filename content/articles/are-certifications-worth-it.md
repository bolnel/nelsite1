If a certain certification or license is required for the position you're seeking, then making a decision is easy - you don't really have a choice. [Examples of obligatory certifications].

But what if it's not strictly necessary? While you could see the benefits in theory, you're not sure if you should go through with it, given how much time and money obtaining a certification would require. You're looking at the options, pondering: "Is this worth it? And which one should I take in particular?"

"Is it worth it" could be broken into at least two aspects: "Will it help me get a new job or a salary raise?" and "Will the benefits of the knowledge I gain in the process outweigh the costs?"

In this article, we'll see what the answer is in your situation.

## What is your core motivation?

Imagine you already got a certain certification you're considering. If anyone were to ask: "Why did you get this one?", what would your most honest answer be?

- Everyone in my field has it, so I decided to get one
- To get more competitive edge
- I liked the challenge of passing the exam
- It was the cheapest among the ones relevant to my field
- I like getting credentials, and wanted another addition to my list
- The particular job I was interested in required it
- I wanted the knowledge preparing for the exam would give me
- My employer offered taking it, so I decided I might as well do it
- I know the subject very well, and decided to make it official
