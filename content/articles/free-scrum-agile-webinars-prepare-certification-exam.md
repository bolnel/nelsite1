During my PSM exam preparation, I went through nearly all the materials on Scrum.org learning paths – Scrum Master, Product Owner, Software Developer, and Agile Leader.

Among the articles, books, and shorter videos, there were 12 full-width webinars that I diligently watched and learned a lot from. Topics they cover:

* working the Agile way
* building a successful product
* being a leader

If these align with your goals, these webinars will give you insight and inspiration.

Each entry on this list is titled with the main question the webinar answers.

## 1. What impact does Product Owner have?

{{< youtube 5plarx4ZvuE >}}

**Speaker**: Mark Noneman. A Professional Scrum Trainer who teaches the entire curriculum of courses on Scrum.org. He helps organizations around the world with implementing Agile practices.

**Webinar name**: The Empirical Product Owner.

**Found on**: Product Owner Learning Path → Understanding and Applying the Scrum Framework → Empiricism.

**Ninel’s summary**: Product Owner is a steward of the product – the decisions made by them will affect the product long after PO itself is out of the picture. The thermostat analogy for empiricism.

Available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Professional-Product-Owner-Leveraging-Competitive/dp/0134686470) and [Barnes & Noble](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/professional-product-owner-the-don-mcgreal/1138611618?ean=9780134686479).


## 2. What happens if you only pay attention to the “urgent”?

{{< youtube dEHtDfQTNcw >}}

**Speaker**: Daniel Vakanti. Co-Author of the Kanban Guide. Author of the books on Agile forecasting.

**Webinar name**: How an expedite request sunk the Titanic.

**Found on**: [Don't just limit WIP - optimize it!](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/professional-scrum-kanban-psk-dont-just-limit-wip-optimize-it-post-1-3) The subject of expedites comes up the most in the context of Professional Scrum with Kanban certification. It doesn’t have its own learning path but has a list of [suggested reading for PSK I](https://www.scrum.org/resources/suggested-reading-professional-scrum-kanban), and if you click through the links within these materials, you’ll get a few extra nuggets.

**Ninel’s summary**: Always operate at your maximum efficiency. "Expedites" should be system-critical, and not just "we really need this feature".

Radio operators were paid by passengers to relay messages, and weren't paid to relay iceberg warnings to the captain, so they underreported the warnings, based on "value".
