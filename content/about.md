Professionally, I mostly worked as a project manager ([PMP-certified](/articles/pmp-certification-exam-preparation/)) with technical background, head of operations, and general problem preventer. I find joy and excitement in obtaining knowledge, solving challenges, and improving and applying my skills.

I [offer workflow setup & automation services](/workflow-setup-automation-expert-specialist-hire/) in Trello, Asana, Notion, ClickUp, Monady.com and other PM software; using Make, Zapier or n8n for integrations and automating complex flows.

The overall topic of this blog is "Personal Growth via Lifelong Learning" – you’ll see articles about self-education, remote work, certifications and continuous education, and other related subjects.
