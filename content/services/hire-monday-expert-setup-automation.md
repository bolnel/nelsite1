## Workflow specialist for hire – Monday workspace setup and automation

Even when companies operate in the same area, everyone’s workflows have their own peculiarities. Workspace setup also needs to be tailored to make the most sense for your process, accounting for your particular needs, other tools you’re using, your company culture, and other factors.

Once I get a solid idea of your current flows and requirements on our intro call, I’ll translate them into the workspace setup using best practices and [workflow organization principles](/workflow-setup-principles-trello-asana-clickup-notion/).


## An expert to integrate Monday.com with other tools via Make.com, Zapier or n8n

With the power of integration, the options are limitless. Make (former Integromat) is my go-to integration tool, but if the situation calls for it, tools like Zapier, n8n or another tool of choice could be used.


## Monday sales CRM Setup and Workflow Configuration

Monday.com Sales CRM product is based on the functionality of Monday Work Management platform, with some additional features for sales management. In many cases, it makes sense to just have all other boards right in the sales CRM in Monday.

Do you need the sales CRM-specific features in Monday.com, or can your case be handled with the base Work Management product? Contact me and let’s discuss what makes the most sense for your setup.

## Client portal setup in Monday with Make.com

A common need is sharing the status of various projects and tasks with the clients without showing all the internal workings.

It’s possible to set up client portals with tools like Softr or Noloco, but a more lightweight solution I came up with is to set up a system of boards/fields which are connected internally and integrated with Make where needed, plus a set of permissions that will only make certain data visible. The “private column” feature of Monday.com helps with that greatly.


## Monday.com audit and process improvement by a workflow expert

If you’ve been using Monday.com for some time and want to address the bottlenecks or just make quality-of-life improvements, I can give actionable advice and implement the changes where needed.


## Hire a Monday.com consultant for training and team onboarding

Workspace architecture documentation that I write before creating the setup serves as a basis for process instructions document. I’m also addressing any additional questions and feedback the team has, on a call or asynchronously via email.  


## Monday reporting & dashboard setup

Charts with a snapshot or key workspace information will provide insights into health and efficiency of your workspace, and reporting will help see the trends over time and make informed decisions.
