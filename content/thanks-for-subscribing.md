Happy to have you here! You're among the first to show interest in the e-book : )

It's actually still in progress: given that the site doesn't have much traffic yet and the average visitor-to-subscriber ratio, I wasn't sure people would attempt downloading the book any time soon.

So, I've been prioritizing articles to add more content to the website.

But once people start subscribing, I'll try to finish the e-book as soon as possible and send it over.

Thanks!

Ninel
