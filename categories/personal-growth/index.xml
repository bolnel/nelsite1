      <description>&lt;p&gt;Impostor syndrome is more common than you might think. For all you know, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7174434/&#34;&gt;over half of your friends and colleagues&lt;/a&gt; might be experiencing it – and saying nothing, because, of course, they don’t want to be outed as impostors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The impostor phenomenon could be a big impediment to your career growth – or worse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Being reluctant to raise your rates or ask for a promotion is one thing. But when a person works in an environment they hate, feeling like they got to that position by chance, and things will only get worse for them if they leave – that is dangerous for mental and even physical health.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What are boundaries, and why are they so important for your personal and professional &lt;a href=&#34;https://ninel.work/articles/how-life-success-factors/&#34;&gt;life success and satisfaction&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The laws of the state are explicit, and if someone breaks a law, they’ll be &lt;strong&gt;prosecuted&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ethics and morale are widely agreed on in society, and if someone acts unethically, they’ll face &lt;strong&gt;social consequences&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But the individual, personal boundaries have no universal rules. There’s a consensus on some things: for example, asking strangers about their personal life is intrusive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Developing Intuition With Learning and Self-Awareness</title>
      <link>https://ninel.work/articles/develop-intuition-learning-self-awareness/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Does your &amp;ldquo;gut feeling&amp;rdquo; ever lie to you?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How many times did you wish you trusted your initial instinct? Or regretted the decision you made without thinking it through because at the moment it felt &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo;? Are you irritated that ` you keep overthinking things, and the opportunities slip away?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Intuition is a spontaneous insight without conscious reasoning. It&amp;rsquo;s not necessarily correct. But when we talk about developing intuition, the intent is learning to make quick judgments that would bring desirable outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
