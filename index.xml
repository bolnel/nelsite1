      <description>Are you the best guy or gal for the job?
I’m sure you’re qualified. But for the overall outcome, would it be best if you’re the one doing a certain task?
Successful delegation allows for more work to be done better, empowers others, and helps you maintain a healthy work-life balance.
Unsuccessful delegation leads to lots of rework, broken trust, and losses.
The ability to delegate is especially important for project managers, business owners, and other people in leadership positions.</description>

      <guid>https://ninel.work/articles/how-set-maintain-develop-boundaries-strong-healthy/</guid>
      <description>What are boundaries, and why are they so important for your personal and professional life success and satisfaction?
The laws of the state are explicit, and if someone breaks a law, they’ll be prosecuted.
Ethics and morale are widely agreed on in society, and if someone acts unethically, they’ll face social consequences.
But the individual, personal boundaries have no universal rules. There’s a consensus on some things: for example, asking strangers about their personal life is intrusive.</description>

      <description>To achieve our goals, we need to do things repeatedly.
Practicing day after day to maintain and improve our professional skills and physical shape. Repeatedly saying &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; to people who ask for more than we can – or are willing – to give at the moment. Constantly fighting destructive behaviors and habits. Success isn&amp;rsquo;t a one-time feat, it&amp;rsquo;s compounded from small building blocks. And the foundation for life success is consistency.</description>

      <title>Taking the PRINCE2 Exams Without a Textbook: an Experiment</title>

      <description>You need to answer barely over half of the questions to pass the test.
That doesn’t sound like a challenge. Or does it?..
When I first learned that the pass mark for PRINCE2 certifications by Axelos is about 55%, it almost struck me as an unfair advantage. For example, the passing score for the Professional Scrum Master exam is 85%. That exam, however, doesn’t have any kind of proctoring.
PRINCE2 is proctored, but on the Practitioner level, you’re allowed to use the official manual.</description>

      <description>PRINCE2 Agile is an extension of the PRINCE2 method, tailored to an Agile environment.
Given that PRINCE2 is one of the most popular certifications today, does the same go for PRINCE2 Agile? Is it a certification you should obtain?
PRINCE stands for “Projects in controlled environments”. “Controlled” is associated with “strict, pre-defined”, and Agile is the opposite of that. How could PRINCE2 be Agile?
That’s what we’ll discuss today.
How do the PRINCE2 method and the Agile approach gel together?</description>

      <description>So, here we are at last.
You’re sure that project management is the right career for you.
You feel that you acquired enough professional experience to apply for the most famous project management certification in the world.
And it’s a great time to do it! Today, the PMP certification is more accessible than it has ever been before:
Simplified work experience requirements. An option to take a proctored test remotely. Since early 2023, the pricing is region-based, so the exam got more affordable for many potential applicants.</description>

      <description>To maintain the standards and enhance the credibility of its certifications, PMI randomly audits a number of applicants.
Project Management Professional is the most popular certification by PMI, so the audit is usually discussed in the context of PMP. But those who apply for CAPM, PMI-ACP, and other certifications could be audited as well.
If selected for audit, they’ll have to present proof of work experience, academic education, and contact hours they listed on their application.</description>

      <description>Project Management Professional certification is the most recognized PM credential worldwide.
You most likely saw the PMP abbreviation way before you started looking into obtaining a certification, and probably even before you took on a project management role.
As the world adopts Agile approaches more and more, you might be wondering: is PMP still relevant?
The short answer is “yes”. The certification issuer, PMI, constantly adapts. With the recent exam modifications and the introduction of a flexible pricing structure, taking the PMP exam is a great option for anyone who fits the eligibility requirements.</description>

      <description>Let me make a few assumptions about you.
I assume that at this point you’re sure that project management is the right occupation for you.
Most probably, you already work as a PM and want to enhance your professional profile and gain new knowledge by getting a professional certification.
PMP is recognized worldwide, but PRINCE2 is also a well-known and respected project management certification.
In this article, we’ll talk about their similarities and differences, which one is harder to get, and which of them will be the most relevant for you.</description>

      <description>Spoiler alert: the PRINCE2 Foundation and Practitioner exams themselves are relatively easy, as far as the certification exams go. You need to get a little over half of the questions right to pass, versus around 70% for PMP or 85% for PSM.
But figuring out the exam cost and actually booking it is less than straightforward…

      <description>Product Owner isn&amp;rsquo;t a job title but an accountability in Scrum.
It&amp;rsquo;s a person responsible for maximizing value by defining the product goal, optimizing the product backlog, turning feedback into actionable items, and guiding the team toward the product vision.
This requires a combination of business acumen, market awareness, leadership skills, intuition, and other factors.
Will obtaining the Professional Scrum Product Owner certification prove – and improve – those skills? Is getting PSPO worth it?</description>

      <description>Does your &amp;ldquo;gut feeling&amp;rdquo; ever lie to you?
How many times did you wish you trusted your initial instinct? Or regretted the decision you made without thinking it through because at the moment it felt &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo;? Are you irritated that ` you keep overthinking things, and the opportunities slip away?
Intuition is a spontaneous insight without conscious reasoning. It&amp;rsquo;s not necessarily correct. But when we talk about developing intuition, the intent is learning to make quick judgments that would bring desirable outcomes.</description>

      <description>Scrum is a framework for solving complex problems. It’s mainly used for software and product development but could be applied to any project with evolving requirements and short feedback loops.
Obtaining a Scrum certification is a way of transitioning into a new role, developing an Agile mindset, and improving your practical application of the framework.
Professional Scrum Master by Scrum.org and Certified Scrum Master by Scrum Alliance are the most popular certifications for people planning to take on the Scrum Master role or already working in that role and wishing to formalize and improve their knowledge and practices.</description>

      <title>Online Proctored Testing at Home: Pros &amp; Cons. Where to Take Your Exam?</title>

      <description>One of the silver linings to the 2020 COVID pandemic was that the certification providers became much more open to online testing. Now everyone offers this option, so you could take a test from the comfort of your own home.
There are a few caveats, though. I took my certification tests online, and I&amp;rsquo;ll likely continue to do so in the future. But every time at a certain point I wished I were in a test center instead.</description>

      <title>Top 6 Cybersecurity Certification Providers&#39; Recertification Costs</title>
      <link>https://ninel.work/articles/top-cybersecurity-providers-recertification-cost/</link>

      <description>So, you decided that it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to get a cybersecurity certification. But which one should you go for?
While obtaining a certification is quite an endeavor, that’s only the first step. To keep it active, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to pay annual fees and submit continuous education units based on the issuers’ requirements. Otherwise, your hard-earned credential will expire, and it will be forbidden and unethical to introduce yourself as a certification holder by listing it in your CV or profile headline.</description>

      <title>Is Getting Certified Worth It? Do the Benefits Outweigh the Costs?</title>

      <description>If the job you seek requires a license, then making a decision is easy – you don&amp;rsquo;t really have a choice. Licensure and certification are both means of verifying your skills and expertise, but they have some distinct differences.
In a nutshell, a license is issued by a government authority and is legally required to practice in a field or hold a certain title. Certification is voluntary, serving as a reassurance to your peers and clients that you meet specific qualifications.</description>
